# Onewire-AGFW-compatible-tempsensor

This is a AGFW-compatible Tempsensor for a 5x45mm (5x50) Housing

If you ever wanted to add a tempsensor to your heating pipes, the only way to do this efficiently and easily is, 
to attach it to the pipe and insulate it properly. But the respone time is less than optimal. A more efficient way
is to use direct immersive sensors, like heat meters do. For this heat meters, you can buy ball valves with a M10x1
opening, where AGFW direct immersed sensor perfectly fit in. These sensors are usually 5,0 x 45 mm or 5,2 x 45 mm.

But if you want to use a 1-wire DS18B20, you can only find 6 mm stainless stell sensors. This is mainly because the standard
cases for DS18B20 is a TO-92 case, which will never fit into a 5 mm tube. But there is the DB18B20U, that is fittet into a uMAX8 (or uSOP-8)
packages, that perfectly fits into the tube, but it needs some support from a PCB to be usable.

This is, what this repo is for. You will find 3D-Models, the schematics, the PCB design files and some specs, how the tube needs to be pressed.

Later, I'll also provide the CAD files for some tools to aid in pressing the steel tube correctly.
